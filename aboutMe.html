      <p>
        I'm Camille! I love knitting and crocheting, among other things. I
        always have a project or two handy for when I get a spare moment. I'm
        currently taking Art History, Physics, and Digital Media, and learning a
        lot! I have a dog. His name's Otis and he's a Havanese mix rescue, and I
        love him a lot. I like web development because I like learning how to
        make websites and sharing them with my friends :)
